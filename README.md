NeoTrack: Preterm Growth & Nutrition Calculator
NeoTrack is a comprehensive clinical web application designed to assist healthcare professionals in managing the growth and nutritional intake of preterm infants.

This tool provides detailed calculations for:

Enteral Nutrition: Calculates daily intake for a wide range of nutrients based on the type of milk/formula and fortification, comparing the results against the 2022 ESPGHAN guidelines.

Growth Velocity: Determines the baby's weight gain velocity in g/kg/day.

Anthropometry & Z-Scores: Calculates sex-specific Z-scores and the change in Z-scores (Î”Z) for weight, length, and head circumference based on the Fenton 2013 growth charts.
